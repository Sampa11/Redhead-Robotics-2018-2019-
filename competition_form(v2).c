		/*CHANGE LOG:

		9/20/2018: Changed the condition in the while loop from 1==1 to true- it's a matter of personal preference, but either works.
		Changed the control structure from if/else if/else form to a if/else if/else form. Changed commands in lift to mirror the control
		of the base. Are the units in the wait command seconds? Debating the removal of the stopMotor/motor = 0 and commands from within
		the up and down functions for the lift. Removed the == 1 from the button control, its uneccesary. No auton yet.
		Adding code for the claw.

		9/25/2018: Moved the main driver code into a competition template to get started on auton as soon as possible.
		Added a new way to access between Tank Control and Arcade Control with a switch of a button. Button 7L == Arcade
		while button 7R == Tank.
		Adjusted the speed of the motors for the lift and for the claw. The speeds should be controllable enough to start
		close looping the claw a little more.
		Also changed the if else statement to a if statement so there will be less of a pause while moving the robot.

		9/27/2018: The toggle between tank and arcade control is a good addition, though Kolby is ok with just tank.
		Changed the names of the variables in the tank/arcade toggle to be more self-explanatory.
		Not too worried about functionality that can be fixed with testing yet.
		Changed the format back to if/else if/else because the current  setup will cause the robot to be unable to move the lift upwards,
		as the second if/else statement will cause the motor speeds to always be negative or 0.
		Made changes to the claw code as well.
